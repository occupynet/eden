GETTING STARTED

Start by copying js/config.sample.js to js/config.js and replace with 
values specific to your SIP server.

In addition, you need to follow the directions in js/sipml/README to
download the sipml5 library (https://code.google.com/p/sipml5/) and create a
symlink to the relevant files in that library.

INTERNATIONALIZATION

extract-strings and generate-pages are bash scripts used to handle
internationalization. Place all language strings in index.base enclosed in pipes
(e.g. |This is a language string|). Then run extract-strings to extract all
strings into translation.es. Then, add translations to translation.es. Lastly,
run generate-pages to generate an index.en.html and index.es.html page.
